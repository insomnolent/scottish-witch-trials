                      <p class="intro-text" style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.5">In this project, we contextualized the history of the early modern witch hunts in both the European and Scottish frame. We gave an account for the accused and the accusers in a socioeconomic perspective. The portrait we have created of the frequently accused answers the questions of who they were, how they fit into the overall Scottish witch hunt narrative, and why they were accused. We explored the themes most relevant for each time period. The years of interest will be from the 1500s to the early 1700s, with emphasis in the peaks in the years of 1590-1591 and 1597, 1628-1630 and 1649, and 1661-1662. The Scottish witch hunts highlighted the economic disparity of these women and how their abnormal social status was used against them in both cultural and economic leverage. This leverage was then used against them to silence and erase the accused women.

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5" style="margin: auto">The Scottish witch-hunt lasted from about 1550 to 1700. Approximately three thousand people were accused of witchcraft. According to Julian Goodare in The Scottish witch-hunt in context, over a thousand people were executed and two thousand were accused but escaped execution. The typical “witch” possessed key traits. Approximately 85% of the accused were women, and the graph on the right also shows a disproportionately high amount of females compared to males.</p>

Goodare writes in "Women and the Witch-Hunt in Scotland", that “the typical witch was not only female: she was poor … she was not usually much poorer than her neighbors”, and is usually “settled in the community rather than a really marginal vagrant or beggar.”</p>

          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; margin: auto">In addition, the marital status of the “witch” is hard to determine. According to Goodare in “Women and the Witch-Hunt in Scotland”, it is hard to determine the marital status because not many records would indicate if the accused were married unless the husband acted as the accuser or came to their wife’s defense. Goodare goes on to say, the most likely situation was that women without a husband were targeted because they had no man to defend them in the trials. For this reason, we have to scrutinize our data and take into account that the entries collected will be skewed to have indicate more records of married women.</p>

                  <h2>Reasons for Accusations</h2>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">There were various reasons as to why women were accused. In The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Contest, Julian Goodare posits that “witchcraft was a part of a broader pattern of moral offences for which women were given increased criminal responsibility”. These moral offences are related to sex, witchcraft is associated with sexual relations with the Devil as well. This explains the repeated implication of women as witches during the periods of mass hysteria. The nature of the accusations exacerbated the hysteria. Reputations of witchcraft are built from words and gossip.</p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">In the same study, Goodare expressed that a man’s honor was protected by physical violence and a woman’s was only safe by what others had to say about them. Witch accusations came into effect at high times of communal tension (we will explore what these were in the Timeline section). Aggression and frustrations with neighbors ran high and many were tense and willing to accuse a community member if that person contributed to societal tensions. The fact that accusations were spread by word of mouth explains why male witches were not typically charged or accused with cursing, in both the magic and foul language connotations of the word. Women could be easily implicated through cursing with magic, insults, and quarrels. The highly gendered nature of the accusation was one of the main reasons why women, as opposed to men, were so often accused of witchcraft in 16th century Scotland. </p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">The witch hunter played a significant role as to why women were accused. In The Great Scottish witch Hunt of 1661-1662, Levack highlights that men in power, such as judges and landowners held status that was used to accuse and persecute these women. Work, and other aspects of life relating to economic standing, were used to manipulate the power structure so women were accused and then later confessed to the crimes of witchcraft. This is exemplified in Witchcraft and Belief in Early modern Scotland, men that had multiple interactions with women were the accusers. If a man continually worked with women in their profession, they often came forward as accusers in the trials. This included men in the professions of millers and craftsmen. Another profession that played a big role in the accusation of women in the witchcraft trials were the clergy members. In The Witches of Fife: witch-hunting in a Scottish Shire, 1560-1710 Stuart  Macdonald highlighted the narrative shift of witches to demonic witches. The old portrayal of a witch is a woman in tune with nature and who served herself. This transformed into a “demonic” witch who sought to serve the devil. Macdonald details, in response to the tensions between the Church and the state during the height of the trials, local parishes sought to create a more “Jesus centered” society.  </p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">Churches and the parishioners sought to tackle moral issues that could corrupt localities and this included witches and anything that could be seen as glorifying to Satan. . Lauren Martin in Witchcraft, quarrels and women’s work states that many of the women were known as witches in their communities for years before they came to trial. There was a push from the church to stop anti-church practice. Neighbors of the witches would accuse these women even though they were considered valuable members of the community before. Men were the accusers because many were in high places of power. They wanted to enforce a power structure that benefitted them economically. If women were always treated as second class, men were guaranteed a higher economic status. The church pushed the “demon witch” narrative to have communities with common morals. Parishes sought to create a religious state that was more in line with popular morals of anti-satanic belief. The society they envisioned was family centered and aligned with Abrahamic traditions of power relationships.</p>

                      <p>In addition from the general mass hysteria that provided much of the momentum for the Scottish witch trials, there were several events throughout the 16th and 17th century that triggered periods when accusations of witchcraft were abnormally high. This is supported by Stuart Macdonald in In Search of the Devil in Fife Witchcraft Cases, 1560-1705 as he posits that “the timing of the major hunts coincides closely with significant events, some political, some intellectual and social”.</p>

<p> As we can see from the timeline graph above, there are five peaks when accusations were abnormally high: the years 1590-1591, 1597, 1628-1630, 1649, and 1661-1662. These periods of high accusations are corroborated by Christina Larner, the pioneering modern scholar of Scottish witch-hunting (Robertson, 1).</p>
            
<h3>1590-1591</h3>

<p>Between 1590-1591, our data shows a total of 77 accusations, which is significantly higher than the average of 3 accusations per year in the previous decades. What triggered this two-year period of mass hysteria was the attempts to poison King James VI, and to sink the King’s ship on his voyage back to Scotland (Murray, 48). </p>

<p>The first witch implicated in the assassination of King James VI, Geillis Duncane, was accused of witchcraft due to her tendencies towards healing practices and her ‘witch’s mark’ (Carmichael, 11). What ensued was a series of a series of close to 70 accusations, “where the hunt moves out in a serial fashion from one accused to another” (Macdonald, 5). The principal culprits of the plot, Agnes Sampson and Dr. John Fian were then tortured for their confessions (Murray, 55).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/witchcraft-pamphlet-news-from-scotland-1591">Witchcraft pamphlet: News from Scotland, 1591</a></p>

<p>According to the confessions of Agnes Sampson in Newes from Scotland, she gathered venom from a black toad to be applied onto “any parte or peece of foule linnen cloth, that had appertained to the Kings Maiestie” in an attempt to poison the King, and summoned “winde contrarye and altogither against his Maiestie: and further the saide witche declared, that his Maiestie had neuer come safelye from the Sea” in an attempt to sink the King’s ship on his voyage back to Scotland (Carmichael, 17).</p>

<h3>1597</h3>

<p>From our timeline graph, there were 111 accusations made in the year 1597 alone; not only was this higher than the average number of accusations per year, it was also higher than that during the events in 1590-1591.</p>

<p>In the larger European context, there began a larger shift towards creating a morally upright society that aligned with Western religious values. This stemmed from the upper class that was beginning to become more and more educated. According to Macdonald, the 10 educated upper classes started the shift of having the “neighborhood witch” be a friendly and important member of society into a detestable figure that was demonic in nature. In the early years, we see how societal and educational shifts that stemmed from the upper class paired with societal tensions of religion and agriculture to create a hostile environment for anything that deviated from the accepted norm.</p>

<p>According to Goodare in The Scottish Witchcraft Panic in 1597, while the witch-hunt in 1597 is the least documented of the five Great witch-hunts in Scotland, the mass hysteria could be attributed to the rift in the relationship between the Presbyterian church and the king. This difference in ideals separated both facets of life in Scotland, causing strife in the political and religious organizations of the people. Furthermore, Goodare also highlights the famine between the years of 1594 and 1599 which led to mass starvation leading to social tension in the communities. In hand with this, the disease known as ergotism was affecting communities who had risked eating contaminated rye, which may have led to hallucinations and convulsions that could have been interpreted as demonic possession as well.</p>

<h3>1628-1630</h3>

<p>For the years 1628-1630, looking at the timeline graph, we can remark that the peak was higher than any preceding peaks, with a total of 179 individuals accused of practicing witchcraft.</p>

<p>This could be attributed to several international and domestic factors. One of the international forces that prompted the hysteria was the “major continental witch panic” that swept Europe, which Macdonald described in The Witches of Fife: Witch-Hunting in a Scottish Shire. In the mid-1600s, Scotland was not alone in the witch hunt phenomena and was an average example of how the rest of the continent to reacted to the witchcraft and witch-hunting.</p>

<p>The author of Panic and Persecution: Witch-Hunting in East Lothian, 1628-1631, Elizabeth Robertson, commented that the witch-hunt in Berwick (East Lothian) had no particular triggers, and that the exact cause of it remains unclear; however, it is a perfect embodiment of the “panic model” that governed the witch-hunt in 1629. The panic model is characterized by a developing prosecutorial peak “as interest turned from prosecuting individuals accused by their neighbors to seeking out the accomplices of confessing witches” (Robertson, 11).</p>

<h3>1649</h3>

<p>During 1649, the number of accusations rose to nearly twice as much as the previous peak, and was higher than any preceding peak at 367 accusations. On top of the mass witch-hunting hysteria that took over Europe, which Macdonald described, the surge in accusations can be explained by a nationwide instability that was a result of political instability and food shortages.</p>

<p>In 1649, the foundational problems that originated in the late 1500s continued to evolve and cause chaos for the church. This was described in The Witches of Fife: Witch-Hunting in a Scottish Shire, as Macdonald explained that persecutions began “shortly after the radical Presbyterian faction took power in January”. Religious factions and the power change and dynamic between the monarch and the church continued to divide and separate the Scottish lifestyle. </p>

<p>Additionally, according to Goodare in Women and the Witch-Hunt in Scotland, the rising prices of food due to shortages played led to a spike in cost of living in Scotland. Coupled with the increasing divide between the monarch and the church, the soaring cost of living created nationwide instability, which compelled the churches to create order and stability within their community.</p>

<h3>1661-1662 and Subsequent Decline</h3>

<p>Examining the timeline of accusations, there were 233 accusations made in the year 1661. Meanwhile, the year 1662 saw the record highest number of accusations at 396 cases. Like the crisis in 1628-1630, that of 1661-1662 has not been largely researched as well.</p>

<p>In The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1661-1662, Levack suggested that one possible trigger to the events in 1661-1662 could be the “end of the Protectorate, the judicial machinery of Scotland”. As the Protectorate came to a complete halt, Scotland was mired in serious legal crisis, on top of the burgeoning economic crisis. As in 1649, the lack of a nationwide judicial system compelled locals to demand for legal action against suspected witches. This prompted a series of unwarranted arrests and unregulated use of torture to extract confessions, resulting in the highest number of accusations and death toll throughout Scottish witch-hunting history.</p>

<p>In his other study, The decline and end of Scottish Witch-Hunting, Levack proposed that the reasons for decline included a “greater care with which evidence was evaluated at witchcraft trials and the adherence to increasingly evidentiary standards”. This included the prohibition of torture as a means to extract confessions, and a crackdown of unauthorized arrests -- practices which were prevalent during the Great Witch Hunt of 1661-1662.</p>

<p>While some accusations and trials were still made after 1662, they eventually ceased only when the British statute of 1736 “officially determined that witchcraft in Scotland … was no longer a crime” (Levack, 162).</p>

                      <h2>Distribution of Accusations</h2>
<p>Additionally, under our mapping specialist, Albert’s guidance, we created a heat map of the witches accused and the counties they resided in. Based on the heat map, there are two counties whereby witchcraft accusations were abnormally high: Berwick (East Lothian) and Fife. This result is supported by several authors; studies by Goodare, Murray, and Levack identified Berwick as the county where accusations are most concentrated during the periods of hysteria, followed by Fife. </p>

<iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://michellevo.carto.com/builder/aca34684-6f32-4618-90d9-3d1a9af03ac4/embed" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Above is an interactive map that depicts the accusations of witchcraft across Scotland from 1563-1736, with our data aggregated by sex and average age. Hover over the counties to see the average age and quantity of men and women who were accused of witchcraft. You can select from the histogram on the top right to highlight parts of the map according to a particular age average or sex.  </p>

  <p>One non-trivial challenge in creating this map was in geocoding. Our data was based on the counties (or shires) that divided Scotland between 1563 and 1736. In 1974, Scotland reformed the names and boundaries of these counties. Thanks to GIS mapping specialist, Albert Kochaphum, we were able to find the coordinates of these outdated counties and use Carto to generate this heat map. Ideally, we wanted to create a map with a timeline to depict the 5 peaks of witchcraft hysteria during this time, but an issue we encountered was that the information on dates and counties were not on the same dataset. </p>

  <p>You can also see the bar chart below summarizing which counties had the most number of accusations. To clarify, in the past, Haddington, Berwick, and Midlothian were all called Berwick and so the county of Haddington refers to Berwick (which was one of the counties in the heat map that had extremely high counts of accusations).</p>

                      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                      <p class="intro-text" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5">To summarize, the Scottish witch trials exposed the the socio-economic power structures that were in place to diminish the roles of women in society. These women were often poor, old, and without representation from a husband. Women had little agency when placed in this situation and their only weapon to combat prejudice was speech. However, even this is used against the accused to gain false confessions and feed into the growing stereotype of the “demonic witch”. Men exploited their power in economic situations in order to coerce women into submissive roles. The church and judges helped to perpetuate this system in order to create a religious state with a clear gendered hierarchy both nationally and locally. </p>
                      <p class="intro-text" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5">These patterns can be credited to the external events that surrounded the time periods both nationally and continentally. The rhythms of the witch hunt hysteria manifested in time periods and were rooted in specific localities, such as in Haddington and Fife. Instability in the monarchy triggered mass hysteria between 1590 and 1591. In addition, Scotland became swept up in a continental outbreak of witch hunt hysteria which aligned with creating an morally upright society which accounts for panics in 1597 and 1628 to 1630. This is paired with social tensions created by famines. In 1649, these factors came together with large political unrest due to the Presbyterian faction taking power. We see the witch hunt begin to decline in 1661 onward due to the end of national conglomerations of judiciary and the repeal of British witch hunt statutes. The patterns and outbreaks witnessed were in response to external pressure, usually political and agricultural, that spurred localities to act on existing biases against one another. Today, these witch hunts serve as a bitter reminders of the erasure of women from positions of power in localities and fuels ancient beliefs still present today in Scotland.</p>
