              <p style="font-weight: 2">Adam, Isabel. <cite>Witch Hunt: The Great Scottish Witchcraft Trials of 1697.</cite> Great Britain, England : Lowe & Brydone LTD, 1928.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.3">Witch Hunt is a narrative account of the witchcraft trials based on a true story. I’m hoping to see if any of the names of characters in the book are actually documented in our data. If so, it would be useful to highlight individuals in our data and humanize the entries. If not, it would still be useful in getting a feel for how similar individuals lived and the reasons they were persecuted for. 
              Adam questions in her novel there was even any actual witchcraft that occurred during the time. The terror began with with a girl named Christian Shaw, who was the daughter of a Lowland laird. It was followed by many months of witch trials with people from all classes involved in being accused and accusing. Hundreds would attend to watch the trials, and Adam wonders who was responsible for this fearmongering. The story begins with Reverend Andrew Turner who is concerned about Christian Shaw, a girl in his parish that has a “mysterious and distressing illness”. I realized that mental illnesses and disease might have been considered strange and thus “witchcraft” at this time. Christian was described to be “under a very sore and unnatural-like distemper, frequently seized with strange fits, sometimes blind, sometimes deaf and dumb … her body sometimes violently extended… she hath disgorged a considerable quantity of hair” (12). In my opinion, I think Christian might have just been incredibly ill and needed medical attention that didn’t exist at the time. The medicine they did give her worsened her condition, likely because it was snake oil. However, the adverse reaction to physicians’ help at the time was interpreted as a possession of the Devil.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.3">On page 220, Adam exposes how absurd the idea is that an eleven year old girl was bewitched, or otherwise deceiving others as a witch. She notes that after people had died at the hands of the justice system, their own narratives and the account of what they did changed. Christian was no longer remembered as a poor innocent young girl, but somehow a villainess that had “tricked the naive ministers and lawyers into ordering the judicial murder of some poor, innocent creatures for crimes it would have been impossible for them to commit”. It was a weird way to justify their actions, essentially blaming Christian for the deaths of the innocent people in retrospect, rather than owning up to their mistakes. </p>


              <p style="font-weight: 2">Houston, Robert Allan. <cite>Scottish Society, 1500-1800.</cite> Cambridge Univ. Press, 2005.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 1.3">Scottish Society 1500-1800 is a research book that describes the state of Scotland in detail during this pivotal period in its history. The main benefit of the book is its section on “Women in the economy and society”. This section contains detailed accounts about the economic roles, marriages, legal status, education, cultural life, and witchcraft trials of women in Scotland during this time period.  This resource is important for understanding the entire society that influenced the development and implementation of witchcraft trials across the Scottish countryside. It also allows us to compare the timeline of the trials to that of other events, such as when an act in 1591 “allowed women to give evidence in witchcraft trials for the first time” (Houston pg. 132). Within the section is a descriptive macro-look at witchcraft, detailing the factors that likely led to its development and what different groups had at stake in the trials. This work will lend us credible details that may seem logical at first but need to be supported by researched fact. Also, we will have evidence of general factors in the witchcraft trials that can be furthered explored, and timelines of societal shifts that we can investigate in our own data.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 1.3">This book covers the origins of what sort of historical events and movements may have led to the widespread accusations of witchcraft after the 1500s. It attempts to draw conclusions from accounts of European witchcraft trials from 1300s to 1500s, and look at different political, cultural, and social factors involved (especially when taking into account the demographics of people and places where most witchcraft accusations were made). It is important because it acknowledges that there were not as many accusations during these times before the 16th century, which is why the author is curious about investigating this particular phenomenon. This is helpful for our project because it gives us a better understanding of what people thought of witchcraft before the 1500s and what sort of traditions and beliefs may have made people more intolerant and paranoid of witches. Although it doesn’t focus as much on the actual events that our dataset was based on, it gives us a good foundation to start with and we can better build a chronological narrative of the social constructs and motives behind witch trials that led to the numbers in our own data mappings</p>

              <p style="font-weight: 2">Macdonald, S. The Witches of Fife: witch-hunting in a Scottish Shire, 1560-1710. East Linton, 2002.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 1.3">The witches of Fife aims to explain the phenomenon of the Scottish witchcraft trials by examining the cases in a geopolitical context. The author summarizes the shift of witchcraft trial study has changed from a broad context of European witchcraft to a field of study that aims to explain the trials in terms of the location where individual and clustered cases occurred and the societal hierarchy that existed in the area. This work explains the cases of the Scottish witchcraft trials by looking at each specific “presbytery” and by deeply examining the data that is available for each specific location. The author gives a brief history of the area and highlights key figures in area that play important roles in the witch trials, such as clergy members or nobility. Analysis then moves to how the each presbytery fits into the bigger narrative of the Scottish witch trials, such as if the cases affected how accused witches were prosecuted later or if the cases in the presbytery fit in with the national trend that begins to emerge within the work. As Macdonald states, “No regional study of a witch-hunt exists for Scotland. Instead, we have an extremely good overview of the national situation… and discussions of some of the more dramatic and famous cases. [The work] will attempt to remedy this situation by exploring how a witch-hunt developed over this period in particular areas of Fife,” (33). Macdonald achieves this and concludes that in the presbyteries that are discussed (Cupar, St. Andrews, Kirkcaldy, and Dunfermline) the patterns that emerge are that the clergy played the most significant role in the witch hunts, that demonic association of the witches came at national levels rather than at the local, that the trials led to belief of witches in rural areas for many years after, even with the decline of the trials, and that women were the primary target in the trials due local elites wanting to shape a society more in line with accepted morals and centered on God. The work will aid in our analysis of the witch trials being geographically situated. We can use the data presented and compare it with our own in order to explain the patterns that we see emerge in our data. In addition, it will give us more context for the witch trials by providing a history we can look at and be able to answer how what the lasting effects of the trials in the area. Furthermore, we can add this concept of a “godly society” that Macdonald presents to aid our explanation of why women were the center of the witchcraft trials.</p>

              <p style="font-weight: 2">Scarre, Geoffrey & Callow, John. Witchcraft and Magic in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Europe. Palgrave. Basingstoke, Hampshire, 2001.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 1.3">Witchcraft and Magic in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Europe is a book that describes the developments of the witchcraft trials in Europe during the 1500s and 1600s, specifically how stereotypes of witches are formed, and provides potential explanations for the accusations. In particular, the authors impressed that “witch prosecution was largely an instrument of social control, a method employed by the powerful to extend or consolidate their hold over the weak” (p50). These specific reasons could include “financial gain or [boosting] self-importance of local officials” (p52), or even an unhappiness to women's self-sufficiency, which explains why most accusations were targeted at women. This is important in helping us draw connections to the real reasons why individuals are prosecuted. Moreover, the book describes the process by which the trials are carried out, i.e. through means of force or even torture (p69), which is useful as not only does it shed light to the inhumane nature of the prosecutions, but also in solidifying the notion that the basis of these trials are ungrounded in science.</p>


              <p style="font-weight: 2">Sharpe, Charles Kirkpatrick. A Historical Account of the Belief in Witchcraft in Scotland. Detroit, Gale Research Company : Book Tower, 1974. </p>

              <p style="line-height: 1.3">This book is a consolidation of different narratives of witchcraft cases from 1465 to about 1742—there are multiple accounts of when and/or where people encountered witches and chronologically goes through these events. Along with these carefully compiled incidents, there is also an extensive introduction of that follows the history of appearances of famous witches Scottish history and detailed footnotes that explain a lot of the historical context behind different accounts.</p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.3">This resource is important because it provides a lot of information about people’s experiences with witchcraft and why they believed that they were bewitched or ensnared by supernatural forces, and if they may have other motives for accusing people of being witches. For example, in chapter 4 (which goes from 1594 – 1629) it goes through the doings of the Earl of Argyle’s Witch, who was accused of being “accompanied by a noted witch, on purpose to discover the property and hidden treasures of the inhabitants, by her incantations” (pg 82) and also accounts the burning of Isobel Grierson in 1607, who convicted of going into a male acquaintance’s household in the form of a cat. Although it might seem a bit ridiculous nowadays, seeing the sheer number of trials that range from petty jealousy to actually believing that someone had the power to transform into animals makes it seem like people, especially when scared, were more likely to believe these accusations and convict the ones on trial.
          These accounts provide a more humanistic aspect to our project – instead of focusing on statistics and data-driven research studies, we can analyze these historical events and try to understand the causes and effects of how witchcraft trials happened. It gives us more specific and concrete details of real life people who went through this period of time and shows us how there are so many more factors involved behind Scottish witchcraft trials – and perhaps how it differs from witchcraft accusations that happened in other areas of Europe. </p>
