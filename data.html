              <h3>Information about our dataset</h3>

              <p >Our group has conducted its research project with Scottish Witchcraft datasets created by <a href="http://witches.shca.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh’s Survey of Scottish Witchcraft</a>. The project arose in the 1990s with the desire to compile available information on Scottish witches. The project was conducted from 2001 to 2003. We are using two of their distinct data sets: accused.csv and cases.csv. The accused dataset contains 3219 observations of 31 content types, and the cases dataset contains 3413 total records of 111 content types. This is a large dataset, with detailed categories and a high number of total records. </p>
              <p>The accused dataset has 31 columns that describe those accused of being witches. The variables are mainly string variables, giving the names of those accused, their genders, details about their lives, like career and family, and where the accused lived and went to church. Other details like marriage status and and ethnic origin are included. A very interesting detail is the notes category, which allows us to collect more detailed information on how the accused was portrayed prior to accusation. We also have a record of the data’s creation as the researchers compiled their research notes for the data set. </p>
              <p>The cases dataset is quite large. It contains about 15 variables that describe the details of the witch trials, that were litigated. They include information such as the names, ages, times of trials, meeting notes, and the decisions of the cases. The bulk of the variables are coded to identify cases that meet certain criteria. This criteria was determined by taking the judgements of the court judges during the trials and codifying them when processing the data, creating criteria such as “demonic possessions” or “midwifery”. This criteria information helps identify the reasons these individuals were accused of witchcraft. Additionally, this dataset also contains a notes section for additional information on the witches, such as the end result of their trial, if any was found during research. </p>
              <h3>What our dataset can illuminate</h3>
              <p>With both of these datasets, we can collectively know about the people accused and tried for witchcraft during these centuries. We can see how a witchcraft trial operated, where the trials occurred, why they were carried out, and all the other details provided surrounding the accused and cases. This information is valuable for understanding this large phenomena in Scotland that took place from the early 1500s to the late 1700s. </p>
              <p>However, a challenge that we encountered while analyzing our data was that having two distinct files makes it extremely difficult to find trends between the instances of witchcraft, as well as the corresponding accusations. To facilitate data analysis, we combined the two datasets to create a large, compiled database where both information on ‘cases’ and ‘accused’ could be found on the same file. We used the vlookup function on Microsoft Excel to match and collate all the corresponding data from the ‘cases’ file onto the ‘accused’ file for easier analysis.</p>
              <h3>What our dataset cannot illuminate</h3>
              <p>One major dilemma with the dataset is the lack of complete data. Many of the rows have multiple missing columns, which really limits what is available in the dataset. For instance, multiple names are missing from both datasets, which demonstrates weakness in the archive. This is often due to a lack of a historical record on most of those accused and tried as witches, especially during periods of mass accusations.  Of the 3,000 some odd cases, we only know the end result of about 300 of them. This leads us to wonder what happened for the rest of the cases and why and how they came to be omitted from the datasets. The lack of record keeping, status of the accused, and the frenzy that often carried some trials can explain some of this lacking data. The data does not contain variables to describe the accusers, and also lacks details on economic status of most of the accused. </p>
              <p>If our data was our only source, it would be difficult for us to understand and extrapolate the historical context and backdrop of the Scottish witch trials. For example, when we first looked at the data we thought that it was lacking in regards to the information of the accused’s occupation. However, we did not realize, that perhaps, women at the time were not able to have careers outside of the household. We would need to investigate the history through other sources to better understand the social hierarchy and find correlations between social standing, occupation, geography, and other underlying reasons as to why one would be accused of being a witch. We will be gathering this information to find out the factors contributing to the hysteria, as well as understanding the historical backdrop to the Scottish witch trials.</p>
